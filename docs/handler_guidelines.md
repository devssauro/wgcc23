# Handler guidelines

When creating a handler, consider the following guidelines:

- The file name should reflect the context or purpose of the handler. For example, if the handler is used for handling travel-related functions, the file name can be `entity_handler.py`.
- Group a set of functions that work for the same context, such as database operations for the same document in Postgres. This can help keep your code organized and maintainable.
- Keep the handler functions short and focused on a specific task. A handler function should ideally have only one responsibility.
- Use meaningful function and variable names that describe the purpose of the function. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain.
- Avoid hardcoding values inside the handler functions. Instead, use constants or configuration files that can be easily changed if needed.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages. This can help with debugging and troubleshooting.
- Comment the code where necessary to explain complex logic or to provide context.

By following these guidelines, you can create well-organized, maintainable, and easily understandable handler functions that help your application perform the required tasks.
